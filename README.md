# KardSkript

KardSkript is an interactive flashcard application that combines the simplicity of traditional flashcards with the flexibility of scripting.  
Think of it as **Anki + scripting**: every line of code you write generates flashcards that can be displayed, dragged, zoomed, and customized on the board.
